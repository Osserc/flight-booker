I definitely had a much easier time navigating this app compared to my previous one, although I had a little bit of trouble getting the nested forms to show up and interface correctly with my controllers.

I also peeked a little further down the curriculum, and decided to challenge myself to add a mailing system. I am pleased to say that I pulled it off reasonably fast.

No deployment on Heroku this time, maybe once I get around to SendGrid I will.
